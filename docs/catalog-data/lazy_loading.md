# Lazy loading

From Kedro version **`0.19.10`** `DataCatalog` introduces a helper class called `_LazyDataset` to improve performance and optimize dataset loading.

## What is `_LazyDataset`?
`_LazyDataset` is a lightweight internal class that stores the configuration and versioning information of a dataset without immediately instantiating it. This allows the catalog to defer actual dataset creation (also called materialization) until it is explicitly accessed.
This approach reduces startup overhead, especially when working with large catalogs, since only the datasets you actually use are initialized.

## When is `_LazyDataset` used?
When you instantiate a `DataCatalog` from a config file (such as `catalog.yml`), Kedro doesn't immediately create all the underlying dataset objects. Instead, it wraps each dataset in a `_LazyDataset` and registers it in the catalog.
These placeholders are automatically materialized when a dataset is accessed for the first time-either directly or during pipeline execution.

```bash
In [1]: catalog
Out[1]: {
  'shuttles': kedro_datasets.pandas.excel_dataset.ExcelDataset
}

# At this point, 'shuttles' has not been fully instantiatedâ€”only its config is registered.

In [2]: catalog["shuttles"]
Out[2]: kedro_datasets.pandas.excel_dataset.ExcelDataset(
    filepath=PurePosixPath('/Projects/default/data/01_raw/shuttles.xlsx'),
    protocol='file',
    load_args={'engine': 'openpyxl'},
    save_args={'index': False},
    writer_args={'engine': 'openpyxl'}
)

# Accessing the dataset triggers materialization.

In [3]: catalog
Out[3]: {
    'shuttles': kedro_datasets.pandas.excel_dataset.ExcelDataset(
        filepath=PurePosixPath('/Projects/default/data/01_raw/shuttles.xlsx'),
        protocol='file',
        load_args={'engine': 'openpyxl'},
        save_args={'index': False},
        writer_args={'engine': 'openpyxl'}
    )
}
```

## When is this useful?
This lazy loading mechanism is especially beneficial before runtime, during the warm-up phase of a pipeline. You can force materialization of all datasets early on to:

- Catch configuration or import errors
- Validate external dependencies
- Ensure all datasets can be created before execution begins

Although `_LazyDataset` is not exposed to end users and doesn't affect your usual catalog usage, it's a useful concept to understand when debugging catalog behavior or troubleshooting dataset instantiation issues.
