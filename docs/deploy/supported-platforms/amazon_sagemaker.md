# Amazon SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker provides the components used for machine learning in a single toolset that supports both classical machine learning libraries like [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) or [`XGBoost`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/), and Deep Learning frameworks such as [`TensorFlow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/).

Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service and its features are covered by the [official service documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/index.html).

## The `kedro-sagemaker` plugin

The `kedro-sagemaker` plugin from GetInData | Part of Xebia enables you to run a Kedro pipeline on Amazon Sagemaker. Consult the [GitHub repository for `kedro-sagemaker`](https://github.com/getindata/kedro-sagemaker) for further details, or take a look at the [documentation](https://kedro-sagemaker.readthedocs.io/).
