# Cookie Policy

Last updated: December 15, 2025

This Cookie Policy explains how cookies and similar technologies are used on docs.kedro.org (the "Site"). The Site is built using MkDocs and hosted on Read the Docs.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. Websites may also use similar technologies, such as local storage or tracking pixels, to collect information about usage.

## How we use cookies

The documentation site does not rely on cookies for core functionality or content delivery.

Cookies and similar technologies are used only for the purposes described below.

### Analytics and usage measurement

We measure usage of the documentation to understand how visitors interact with the Site and to improve the quality and usability of the documentation.

This includes:

#### Heap Analytics

We use Heap Analytics to collect aggregated usage information, such as:

- Pages viewed
- Navigation patterns
- Approximate location (derived from IP address)
- Device and browser information

Heap may set analytics cookies on the kedro.org domain for this purpose. The data collected is used solely for documentation improvement and usage analysis.

#### Read the Docs analytics

The Site is hosted on Read the Docs, which records page views for documentation hosting and reporting purposes. This is implemented via requests to Read the Docs analytics endpoints (for example, `/_/api/v2/analytics/`) and does not rely on user-configurable cookies.

### Infrastructure and security cookies

Read the Docs uses third-party infrastructure providers (such as content delivery and security services) to host and protect the Site. These services may set cookies for purposes such as:

- Security and bot protection
- Abuse prevention
- Performance and reliability

These cookies are part of normal site operation and are not used for marketing or profiling by the documentation site.

### Domain-level cookies

Cookies may also be set at the kedro.org domain level by other Kedro web properties or site operators (for example, the Linux Foundation). These cookies are not set or controlled by the documentation site and may apply across multiple kedro.org subdomains.

The use of such cookies is governed by the applicable privacy and cookie policies of the relevant site operators.

## Managing cookies

The documentation site does not currently provide a built-in mechanism to opt out of analytics collection.

You can manage cookies through your browser settings, including viewing, deleting, or blocking cookies. You may also use private browsing modes or browser-level tracking protection tools.

Please note that blocking certain cookies may affect site security or the accuracy of usage metrics.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
