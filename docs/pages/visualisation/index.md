# Visualisation with Kedro-Viz

[Kedro-Viz](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz) is a key part of Kedro. It visualises the pipelines in a Kedro project by showing data, nodes, and the connections between them.

The Kedro-Viz package needs to be installed separately as it is not part of the standard Kedro installation:

```bash
pip install kedro-viz
```

Consult the [Kedro-Viz documentation](https://docs.kedro.org/projects/kedro-viz/en/latest/) to find out more about how to use the package.
