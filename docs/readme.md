### 📚 Documentation - local setup guide

This guide will help you set up and run the documentation site locally using MkDocs.

---

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Ensure you have an **active Conda environment** set up.

---

### 📦 Install dependencies

To install the documentation dependencies locally, run:

```
pip install -e ".[docs]"
```

This installs all required packages needed to build and serve the documentation.

---

### 🚀 Run documentation locally

Once the installation is complete, start the MkDocs development server with:

```
mkdocs serve
```

You can now view the documentation in your browser at:

👉 [http://127.0.0.1:8000/pages/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/pages/)

### Components library

This guide provides examples of commonly used MkDocs components (using the Material for MkDocs theme) to help you write clear and consistent documentation.

#### Admonitions
Admonitions are used to highlight different types of information using callouts. Use the appropriate type depending on the message you want to convey.
For other supported types from MkDocs https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#supported-types

#### Code blocks

Use code blocks to display syntax-highlighted examples. You can also use collapsible blocks for large code snippets.

**Inline code block (not expanded):**

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

**Collapsible (expanding) code block:**

```
??? example "View code"
    ```python
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world!")
    ```
```
