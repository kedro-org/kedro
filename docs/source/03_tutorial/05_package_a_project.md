# Packaging a project

In this section, you will learn how to build your project documentation, as well as how to bundle your project into a Python package for handover.

## Add documentation to your project

While Kedro documentation can be found by running `kedro docs` from the command line, project-specific documentation can be generated by running `kedro build-docs` in the project's root directory.

This will create documentation based on the code structure of your project. Documentation will also include the [`docstrings`](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/docstrings-python) defined in the project code. The resulting HTML files can be found in `docs/build/html/`.

`kedro build-docs` uses the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) framework to build your project documentation, so if you want to customise it, please refer to `docs/source/conf.py` and the [corresponding section](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html) of the Sphinx documentation.

## Package your project

You can package your project by running `kedro package` from the command line. This will create one `.egg` file  and one `.whl` file within the `src/dist/` folder of your project, which are Python packaging formats. For further information about packaging for Python, documentation is provided [here](https://packaging.python.org/overview/).

## Manage project dependencies

Ensuring that you have accounted for all Python package versions that your project relies on encourages reproducibility of your Kedro project. Use the `kedro build-reqs` CLI command to pin package versions. It works by taking a `requirements.in` file (or `requirements.txt` if the first one does not exist), resolving all package versions using [pip compile](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools#example-usage-for-pip-compile) and _freezing_ them by putting pinned versions back into `requirements.txt`. It significantly reduces the chances of dependencies issues due to downstream changes as you would always install the same package versions using `kedro install`.

## Extend your project

- You can also check out [Kedro-Docker](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-docker), an officially supported Kedro plugin for packaging and shipping Kedro projects within [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

- We also support converting your Kedro project into an Airflow project with the [Kedro-Airflow](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-airflow) plugin.

## What is next?

You have now successfully built a project along with its documentation and packaged it using one of standard Python distribution formats. You may choose to open-source your project and make it available to a wider community of users and contributors. For further steps we advise you to consult [this GitHub guide](https://github.com/open-source), [PyPI help](https://pypi.org/help/), a [Read the Docs tutorial](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html#), and a guide on [Open Source Licenses & Standards](https://opensource.org/licenses).
