# Join the Technical Steering Committee

A group of maintainers on the Kedro project is known as the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). The TSC has many responsibilities surrounding the project's future development; you can read about our duties in our Technical Charter. We accept new members on the TSC as this fuels Kedro's continued development. You can see [a list of Kedro's current and past maintainers](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/12_faq/01_faq.html#who-maintains-kedro).

In this section, we detail:
 * [Responsibilities of a maintainer](#responsibilities-of-a-maintainer)
 * [Requirements to become a maintainer](#requirements-to-become-a-maintainer)
 * [Application process](#application-process)
 * [Removing a maintainer](#removing-a-maintainer)


## Responsibilities of a maintainer

| Theme | Activity |
|---|---|
| Product development | * Be available for at least one full day per week to help with product development<br>* Attend community meetings to discuss the project plans and roadmap<br>* Project maintenance including security, updates, CI/CD, builds and infrastructure<br>* Prioritize the work following the product roadmap to move the project forward |
| Community management | * Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them<br>* Guide the community to use the right channel:<br>  * [Github](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/) for feature requests and bug reports<br>  * [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/akJDeVaxnB), but the former is often preferable since it will be picked up by search engines |


## Requirements to become a maintainer

Just contributing does not make you a maintainer; you need to demonstrate commitment to Kedro's long-term success by
working with existing maintainers for a period.

We look for commitment markers with the following:

* Being able to write solid code and collaborate with the team and community
* Understanding the project's code base and internals
* Doing PRs from our backlog or roadmap; maintainers need to work towards a common goal
* Learning how the team works, including processes for testing, quality standards and code review
* Evidence of already having started PRs and code reviews under the guidance of maintainers; including asking for help where needed


## Application process

Quarterly, existing maintainers will curate a list of contributors that have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this list, maintainer candidates are selected and proposed for a vote.

Following a successful vote, candidates are added to the `kedro-developers` team on the Kedro GitHub organisation
and the `kedro-team` group on the Kedro Discord organisation.


# Removing a Maintainer
The TSC will also have a mechanism for removing a maintainer who is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above. In that case, they should volunteer for non-voting Contributor or Friends status. In extreme cases, this can also occur by a vote by the active TSC.
