# Join the Technical Steering Committee

The term "Technical Steering Committee (TSC)" describes the group of people that maintain Kedro. The TSC has many responsibilities surrounding the project's future development; you can read about our duties in our [Technical Charter](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/blob/main/kedro_technical_charter.pdf). We accept new members on the TSC as this fuels Kedro's continued development. You can see [a list of Kedro's current and past maintainers](../12_faq/01_faq.html#who-maintains-kedro).

In this section, we detail:
- [Responsibilities of a maintainer](#responsibilities-of-a-maintainer)
- [Requirements to become a maintainer](#requirements-to-become-a-maintainer)
- [Application process](#application-process)
- [Voting process](#voting-process)

## Responsibilities of a maintainer

### Product development

 - Be available for at least one full day per week to help with product development
 - Attend community meetings to discuss the project plans and roadmap
 - Project maintenance including security, updates, CI/CD, builds and infrastructure
 - Prioritize the work following the product roadmap to move the project forward

### Community management

- Make sure that ongoing pull requests are moving forward at the right pace or closing them
- Guide the community to use the right channel:
  - [Github](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/) for feature requests and bug reports
  - [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions)
  - [Discord](https://discord.gg/akJDeVaxnB)

## Requirements to become a maintainer

Just contributing does not make you a maintainer; you need to demonstrate commitment to Kedro's long-term success by
working with existing maintainers for a period.

We look for commitment markers with the following:

- Being able to write solid code and collaborate with the team and community
- Understanding the project's code base and internals
- Doing pull requests from our backlog or roadmap; maintainers need to work towards a common goal
- Learning how the team works, including processes for testing, quality standards and code review
- Evidence of already having started pull requests and code reviews under the guidance of maintainers; including asking
  for help where needed

## Application process

Quarterly, existing maintainers will curate a list of contributors that have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this list, maintainer candidates are selected and proposed for a vote.

Following a successful vote, candidates are added to the `kedro-developers` team on the Kedro GitHub organisation
and the `kedro-team` group on the Kedro Discord organisation.

## Voting process

Voting can change project maintainers and decide on the future of Kedro. The TSC leads it as voting maintainers of Kedro. The voting period is one week and is either performed on GitHub Discussions or through a pull request.

### Other issues or proposals

Open Github Discussions host votes on issues, proposals and changes affecting the future of Kedro. These votes require **a 1/2 majority**.

### Adding or removing maintainers

Adding or removing maintainers requires a pull request against [our team list](../12_faq/01_faq.md#who-maintains-kedro). The decision is made based on TSC members votes in that pull request. Additions and removals of maintainers require **a 2/3 majority**.
