# Kedro's Technical Steering Committee

Kedro is an incubating project within [LF AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/).

The term "Technical Steering Committee" (TSC) describes the group of Kedro maintainers. We list Kedro's [current](#current-maintainers) and [past](#past-maintainers) maintainers on this page.

The TSC is responsible for the project's future development; you can read about our duties in our [Technical Charter](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/blob/main/kedro_technical_charter.pdf). We accept new members into the TSC to fuel Kedro's continued development.

On this page we describe:

## Responsibilities of a maintainer

### Product development

- Be available for at least one full day per week to help with product development
- Attend community meetings to discuss the project plans and roadmap
- Be proactive about project maintenance including security, updates, CI/CD, builds and infrastructure
- Give priority to the work following the product roadmap to move the project forward

### Community management

- Ensure that ongoing pull requests are moving forward at the right pace or closing them
- Guide the community to use our various communication channels:

  - [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) for feature requests and bug reports
  - [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions) to discuss the future of the Kedro project
  - [Slack](https://slack.kedro.org) for questions and to support other users

## Requirements to become a maintainer

Just contributing does not make you a maintainer; you need to demonstrate commitment to Kedro's long-term success by
working with existing maintainers for a period of time.

We look for commitment markers who can do the following:

- Write high-quality code and collaborate with the team and community
- Understand the project's code base and internals
- Make pull requests from our backlog or roadmap; maintainers need to work towards a common goal
- Learn how the team works, including processes for testing, quality standards and code review
- Show evidence of already having started pull requests and code reviews under the guidance of maintainers; including asking
  for help where needed
- Show excitement about the future of Kedro
- Build a collaborative relationship with the existing team

## Past maintainers

Kedro was originally designed by [Aris Valtazanos](https://github.com/arisvqb) and [Nikolaos Tsaousis](https://github.com/tsanikgr) at [QuantumBlack](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack) to solve challenges they faced in their project work. Their work was later turned into an internal product by [Peteris Erins](https://github.com/Pet3ris), [Ivan Danov](https://github.com/idanov), [Nikolaos Kaltsas](https://github.com/nikos-kal), [Meisam Emamjome](https://github.com/misamae) and [Nikolaos Tsaousis](https://github.com/tsanikgr).

## Application process

Every quarter year, existing maintainers will collect a list of contributors that have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months and want to become maintainers. From this list, maintainer candidates are selected and proposed for a vote.

Following a successful vote, candidates are added to the `kedro-developers` team on the Kedro GitHub organisation
and the `kedro-team` channel on the Kedro Slack organisation, and listed as [Kedro maintainers](#current-maintainers).

## Voting process

Voting can change project maintainers and decide on the future of Kedro. The TSC leads the process as voting maintainers of Kedro. The voting period is one week and via a GitHub discussion or through a pull request.

### Other issues or proposals

[Kedro's GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions) section is used to host votes on issues, proposals and changes affecting the future of Kedro, including amendments to our ways of working described on this page. These votes require **a 1/2 majority**.

### Adding or removing maintainers

The decision to add or remove a maintainer is made based on TSC members votes in that pull request. Additions and removals of maintainers require **a 2/3 majority**.

The act of adding or removing maintainers onto the list requires a pull request against the ["Current maintainers" section of this page](#current-maintainers).
