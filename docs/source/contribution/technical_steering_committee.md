# Kedro's Technical Steering Committee

Kedro is an incubating project within [LF AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/).

The term "Technical Steering Committee" (TSC) describes the group of Kedro maintainers and committers. We list Kedro's [current](#current-maintainers) and [past](#past-maintainers) maintainers on this page.

The TSC is responsible for the project's future development; you can read about our duties in our [Technical Charter](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/blob/main/kedro_technical_charter.pdf). We accept new members into the TSC to fuel Kedro's continued development.

On this page we describe:

- [Responsibilities of a maintainer](#responsibilities-of-a-maintainer)
- [Requirements to become a maintainer](#requirements-to-become-a-maintainer)
- [Responsibilities of a committer](#responsibilities-of-a-committer)
- [Requirements to become a committer](#requirements-to-become-a-committer)
- [Current maintainers](#current-maintainers)
- [Past maintainers](#past-maintainers)
- [Application process for maintainers](#application-process-for-maintainers)
- [Voting process](#voting-process)

## Responsibilities of a maintainer

Maintainers are the voting members of the TSC. Beyond contributing to regular development, their primary responsibility is to ensure the long-term success of Kedro.

### Product development

- Be available for at least one full day per week to help with product development
- Attend community meetings to discuss the project plans and roadmap
- Be proactive about project maintenance including security, updates, CI/CD, builds and infrastructure
- Give priority to the work following the product roadmap to move the project forward

### Community management

- Ensure that ongoing pull requests are moving forward at the right pace or closing them
- Guide the community to use our various communication channels:

  - [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) for feature requests and bug reports
  - [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions) to discuss the future of the Kedro project
  - [Slack](https://slack.kedro.org) for questions and to support other users

## Requirements to become a maintainer

Just contributing does not make you a maintainer; you need to demonstrate commitment to Kedro's long-term success by
working with existing maintainers for at least one year.

We look for committers who can do at least some of the following:

- Write high-quality code and collaborate with the team and community
- Make substantial improvements to our documentation, either in terms of content or information architecture
- Bring awareness of industry trends to the team, connect the project to complementary initiatives, help steer the direction
- Give talks about the project at conferences and online events, write blog posts, or other forms of advocacy
- Improve the aesthetics and usability of the project, including its documentation, website, and user interfaces (graphical and textual)
- Understand the project's code base and internals
- Develop valuable plugins that complement the functionality of Kedro
- Make pull requests from our backlog or roadmap; maintainers need to work towards a common goal
- Learn how the team works, including processes for testing, quality standards and code review
- Show evidence of already having started pull requests and code reviews under the guidance of maintainers; including asking
  for help where needed
- Show excitement about the future of Kedro

Appointing new maintainers requires a vote of the TSC,
described in [Adding or removing maintainers](#adding-or-removing-maintainers).

## Responsibilities of a committer

Committers are observer (non-voting) members of the TSC. They are active contributors who are responsible for maintaining the health of the project, participating in planning and technical design decisions, and otherwise acting as part of the core Kedro development team.

## Requirements to become a committer

Existing maintainers can appoint new committers at their discretion by adding them to the `kedro-developers` team on the Kedro GitHub organisation,
the `kedro-tsc` channel on the Kedro Slack organisation, the regular TSC meetings, and the `CITATION.cff` file.

Being appointed as a committer is a form of trust expressed by one or more of the maintainers.
As such, the discretionary process is put in place for practical purposes
and does not result in a lesser obligation for them to adhere to their [responsibilities](#responsibilities-of-a-committer).

## Past maintainers

Kedro was originally designed by [Aris Valtazanos](https://github.com/arisvqb) and [Nikolaos Tsaousis](https://github.com/tsanikgr) at [QuantumBlack](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack) to solve challenges they faced in their project work. Their work was later turned into an internal product by [Peteris Erins](https://github.com/Pet3ris), [Ivan Danov](https://github.com/idanov), [Nikolaos Kaltsas](https://github.com/nikos-kal), [Meisam Emamjome](https://github.com/misamae) and [Nikolaos Tsaousis](https://github.com/tsanikgr).

## Application process for maintainers

At any point, existing maintainers can propose that a contributor who fulfills the [requirements to become a maintainer](#requirements-to-become-a-maintainer) is promoted to maintainer. A TSC [vote](#voting-process) is required.

Following a successful vote, candidates are added to the `kedro-developers` team on the Kedro GitHub organisation,
the `kedro-tsc` channel on the Kedro Slack organisation, the regular TSC meetings, the `CITATION.cff` file,
and the list of [Kedro maintainers](#current-maintainers).

## Voting process

Voting can change project maintainers and decide on the future of Kedro. The voting members of the TSC (maintainers) lead the process. The voting period is one week and via a GitHub discussion or through a pull request.

### Other issues or proposals

[Kedro's GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions) section is used to host votes on issues, proposals and changes affecting the future of Kedro, including amendments to our ways of working described on this page. These votes require **a 1/2 majority**.

### Adding or removing maintainers

The decision to promote a committer to maintainer or remove an existing maintainer is made based TSC members votes in that pull request. Additions and removals of maintainers require **a 2/3 majority** of voting members.

The act of adding or removing maintainers onto the list requires a pull request against the ["Current maintainers" section of this page](#current-maintainers).
