# Learn Kedro with hands-on video

If you like to learn from video, you can follow our [hands-on course "Introduction to Kedro: Building Maintainable Data Pipelines" on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-JJgymPjK5LddZXbIzp9LWurkLGgB-nY).

The course is structured into sections and these are each broken into short videos that cover specific Kedro topics. You'll walk through the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.md) and get hands-on with the example. Along the way, you'll learn key Kedro concepts like datasets and the Kedro Data Catalog, nodes and pipelines, and configuration management.

## Who is this course for?

This course is for data scientists, data engineers and machine learning engineers. You can be junior, mid-level or senior in your field of work. You're likely to be hands-on with projects, or a decision-maker who regularly makes design and implementation choices about Python data products.

We assume you know these concepts:

* Python basics (coding on Jupyter and other notebook interfaces)
* Manipulating data with pandas
* Visualising insights
* Command line basics

We don't assume knowledge of software engineering in Python, so the course contains information about reusability principles, how to create a Python package, and how to use version control.

Please note that we do expect users to have Git installed, as it is a prerequisite for the `kedro new` flow, which is used when creating a new project.

## What you'll learn

In short, you'll learn answers to the following:

* Introduction to Kedro
* What is Kedro? How does it help you create maintainable, reusable data science code?
* How does Kedro fit into the data science ecosystem?
* What do you need to do to create a Kedro project?
* How can you refactor a Jupyter notebook to a Kedro project?
* How do you package Python code as a library?
* How do you work with Kedro projects in VS Code?
* What are namespaces and dataset factories?
* What is needed to deploy a Kedro project using container solutions like Docker and open source orchestrators like Airflow?
* What are Kedro plugins?
* How can you contribute to Kedro?


You don't need to register for the course and you can skip around the sections to find help on a particular area as you pick up the skills needed to build your own Kedro projects.
