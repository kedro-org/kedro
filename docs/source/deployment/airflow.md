# Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is a popular open-source workflow management platform. It is a suitable engine to orchestrate and execute a pipeline authored with Kedro, because workflows in Airflow are modelled and organised as [DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

## Introduction and strategy

The general strategy to deploy a Kedro pipeline on Apache Airflow is to run every Kedro node as an [Airflow task](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html) while the whole pipeline is converted to an [Airflow DAG](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/dags.html). This approach mirrors the principles of [running Kedro in a distributed environment](distributed.md).

Each node will be executed within a new Kedro session, which implies that `MemoryDataset`s cannot serve as storage for the intermediate results of nodes. Instead, all datasets must be registered in the [`DataCatalog`](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/data/index.html) and stored in persistent storage. This approach enables nodes to access the results from preceding nodes.

This guide provides instructions on running a Kedro pipeline on different Airflow platforms. You can jump to the specific sections by clicking the links below, how to run a Kedro pipeline on:

## How to run a Kedro pipeline on Apache Airflow with Astronomer

The following tutorial shows how to deploy an example [Spaceflights Kedro project](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.html) on [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) with [Astro CLI](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/overview), a command-line tool created by [Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/) that streamlines the creation of local Airflow projects. You will deploy it locally first, and then transition to Astro Cloud.

[Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/) is a managed Airflow platform which allows users to spin up and run an Airflow cluster in production. Additionally, it also provides a set of tools to help users get started with Airflow locally in the easiest way possible.

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

* The [Astro CLI installed](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/install-cli)
* A container service like [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v18.09 or higher)
* `kedro>=0.19` installed
* [`kedro-airflow>=0.8`](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins/tree/main/kedro-airflow) installed. We will use this plugin to convert the Kedro pipeline into an Airflow DAG.

### Create, prepare and package example Kedro project

In this section, you will create a new Kedro project equipped with an example pipeline designed to solve a typical data science task: predicting spaceflights prices. You will need to customise this project to ensure compatibility with Airflow, which includes enriching the Kedro `DataCatalog` with datasets previously stored only in memory and simplifying logging through custom settings. Following these modifications, you will package the project for installation in an Airflow Docker container and generate an Airflow DAG that mirrors our Kedro pipeline.

1. To create a new Kedro project, select the `example=yes` option to include example code. Additionally, to implement custom logging, select `tools=log`. Proceed with the default project name, but feel free to add any other tools as desired:

    ```shell
    kedro new --example=yes --name=new-kedro-project --tools=log
    ```

2. Navigate to your project's directory, create a new `conf/airflow` directory for Airflow-specific configurations, and copy the `catalog.yml` file from `conf/base` to `conf/airflow`. This setup allows you to customise the `DataCatalog` for use with Airflow:

    ```shell
    cd new-kedro-project
    mkdir conf/airflow
    cp conf/base/catalog.yml conf/airflow/catalog.yml
    ```

3. Open `conf/airflow/catalog.yml` to see the list of datasets used in the project. Note that additional intermediate datasets (`X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`) are stored only in memory. You can locate these in the pipeline description under `/src/new_kedro_project/pipelines/data_science/pipeline.py`. To ensure these datasets are preserved and accessible across different tasks in Airflow, we need to include them in our `DataCatalog`. Instead of repeating similar code for each dataset, you can use [Dataset Factories](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/data/kedro_dataset_factories.html), a special syntax that allows defining a catch-all pattern to overwrite the default `MemoryDataset` creation. Add this code to the end of the file:

```yaml
"{base_dataset}":
  type: pandas.CSVDataset
  filepath: data/02_intermediate/{base_dataset}.csv
```

In the example here we assume that all Airflow tasks share one disk, but for distributed environments you would need to use non-local file paths.

Starting with kedro-airflow release version 0.9.0, you can adopt a different strategy instead of following steps 2-3: group nodes that use intermediate `MemoryDataset`s into larger tasks. This approach allows intermediate data manipulation to occur within a single task, eliminating the need to transfer data between nodes. You can implement this by running `kedro airflow create` with the `--group-in-memory` flag on Step 6.

4. Open `conf/logging.yml` and modify the `root: handlers` section to `[console]` at the end of the file. By default, Kedro uses the [Rich library](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to enhance log output with sophisticated formatting. However, some deployment systems, including Airflow, don't work well with Rich. Therefore, we're adjusting the logging to a simpler console version. For more information on logging in Kedro, you can refer to the [Kedro docs](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/logging/index.html).

```shell
root:
  handlers: [console]
```

5. Package the Kedro pipeline as a Python package so you can install it into the Airflow container later on:

```shell
kedro package
```

This step should produce a wheel file called `new_kedro_project-0.1-py3-none-any.whl` located at `dist/`.

6. Convert the Kedro pipeline into an Airflow DAG with `kedro airflow`

```shell
kedro airflow create --target-dir=dags/ --env=airflow
```

This step should produce a `.py` file called `new_kedro_project_airflow_dag.py` located at `dags/`.

### Deployment process with Astro CLI

In this section, you will start by setting up a new blank Airflow project using Astro and then copy the files prepared in the previous section from the Kedro project. Next, you will need to customise the Dockerfile to enhance logging capabilities and manage the installation of our Kedro package. Finally, you will be able to run and explore the Airflow cluster.

1. To complete this section, you have to install both the [Astro CLI](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/install-cli) and [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. [Initialise an Airflow project with Astro](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/develop-project) in a new folder outside of your Kedro project. Let's call it `kedro-airflow-spaceflights`

    ```shell
    cd ..
    mkdir kedro-airflow-spaceflights
    cd kedro-airflow-spaceflights
    astro dev init
    ```

3. The folder `kedro-airflow-spaceflights` will be executed within the Airflow container. To run the Kedro project there, you need to copy several items from the previous section into it:
- the `/data` folder from Step 1, containing sample input datasets for our pipeline. This folder will also store the output results.
- the `/conf` folder from Steps 2-4, which includes our `DataCatalog`, parameters, and customised logging files. These files will be used by Kedro during its execution in the Airflow container.
- the `.whl` file from Step 5, which you will need to install in the Airflow Docker container to execute our project node by node.
- the Airflow DAG from Step 6 for deployment in the Airflow cluster.
    ```shell
    cd ..
    cp -r new-kedro-project/data kedro-airflow-spaceflights/data
    cp -r new-kedro-project/conf kedro-airflow-spaceflights/conf
    mkdir -p kedro-airflow-spaceflights/dist/
    cp new-kedro-project/dist/new_kedro_project-0.1-py3-none-any.whl kedro-airflow-spaceflights/dist/
    cp new-kedro-project/dags/new_kedro_project_airflow_dag.py kedro-airflow-spaceflights/dags/
    ```

Feel free to completely copy `new-kedro-project` into `kedro-airflow-spaceflights` if your project requires frequent updates, DAG recreation, and repackaging. This approach allows you to work with kedro and astro projects in a single folder, eliminating the need to copy kedro files for each development iteration. However, be aware that both projects will share common files such as `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, and `.gitignore`.

4. Add a few lines to the `Dockerfile` located in the `kedro-airflow-spaceflights` folder to set the environment variable `KEDRO_LOGGING_CONFIG` to point to `conf/logging.yml` to enable custom logging in Kedro (note that from Kedro 0.19.6 onwards, this step is unnecessary because Kedro uses the `conf/logging.yml` file by default) and to install the .whl file of our prepared Kedro project into the Airflow container:

```Dockerfile
ENV KEDRO_LOGGING_CONFIG="conf/logging.yml" # This line is not needed from Kedro 0.19.6

RUN pip install --user dist/new_kedro_project-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

5. Navigate to `kedro-airflow-spaceflights` folder and launch the local Airflow cluster with Astronomer

```shell
cd kedro-airflow-spaceflights
astro dev start
```

6. Visit the Airflow Webserver UI at its default address, http://localhost:8080, using the default login credentials: username and password both set to `admin`. There, you'll find a list of all DAGs. Navigate to the `new-kedro-project` DAG, and then press the `Trigger DAG` play button to initiate it. You can then observe the steps of your project as they run successfully:

![](../meta/images/kedro_airflow_dag_run.png)

7. The Kedro project was run inside an Airflow Docker container, and the results are stored there as well. To copy these results to your host, first identify the relevant Docker containers by listing them:
```shell
docker ps
```
Select the container acting as the scheduler and note its ID. Then, use the following command to copy the results, substituting `d36ef786892a` with the actual container ID:

```shell
docker cp  d36ef786892a:/usr/local/airflow/data/ ./data/
```


8. To stop the Astro Airflow environment, you can use the command:
```shell
astro dev stop
```

### Deployment to Astro Cloud

You can easily deploy and run your project on Astro Cloud, the cloud infrastructure provided by Astronomer, by following these steps:

1. Log in to your account on the [Astronomer portal](https://www.astronomer.io/) and create a new deployment if you don't already have one:
![](../meta/images/astronomer_new_deployment.png)

2. Use the Astro CLI to log in to your Astro Cloud account:
```shell
astro auth
```
You will be redirected to enter your login credentials in your browser. Successful login indicates that your terminal is now linked with your Astro Cloud account:

![](../meta/images/astronomer_connected.png)

3. To deploy your local project to the cloud, navigate to the `kedro-airflow-spaceflights` folder and run:
```shell
astro deploy
```

4. At the end of the deployment process, a link will be provided. Use this link to manage and monitor your project in the cloud:

## How to run a Kedro pipeline on Amazon AWS Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)

### Kedro project preparation
MWAA, or Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow, is an AWS service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale Apache Airflow in the cloud. Deploying a Kedro pipeline to MWAA is similar to Astronomer, but there are some key differences: you need to store your project data in an AWS S3 bucket and make necessary changes to your `DataCatalog`. Additionally, you must configure how you upload your Kedro configuration, install your Kedro package, and set up the necessary environment variables.
1. Complete steps 1-4 from the [Create, prepare and package example Kedro project](#create-prepare-and-package-example-kedro-project) section.
2. Your project's data should not reside in the working directory of the Airflow container. Instead, [create an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html) and [upload your data folder from the new-kedro-project folder to your S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html).
3. Modify the `DataCatalog` to reference data in your S3 bucket by updating the filepath and add credentials line for each dataset in `new-kedro-project/conf/airflow/catalog.yml`. Add the S3 prefix to the filepath as shown below:
```shell
companies:
  type: pandas.CSVDataset
  filepath: s3://<your_S3_bucket>/data/01_raw/companies.csv
  credentials: dev_s3
```
4. [Set up AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/access.credentials.html) to provide read and write access to your S3 bucket. Update `new-kedro-project/conf/local/credentials.yml` with your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and copy it to the `new-kedro-project/conf/airflow/` folder:
```shell
dev_s3:
  client_kwargs:
    aws_access_key_id: *********************
    aws_secret_access_key: ******************************************
```
5. Add `s3fs` to your project’s `requirements.txt` in `new-kedro-project` to facilitate communication with AWS S3. Some libraries could cause dependency conflicts in the Airflow environment, so make sure to minimise the requirements list and avoid using `kedro-viz` and `pytest`.
```shell
s3fs
```

6. Follow steps 5-6 from the [Create, prepare and package example Kedro project](#create-prepare-and-package-example-kedro-project) section to package your Kedro project and generate an Airflow DAG.
7. Update the DAG file `new_kedro_project_airflow_dag.py` located in the `dags/` folder by adding `conf_source="plugins/conf-new_kedro_project.tar.gz"` to the arguments of `KedroSession.create()` in the Kedro operator execution function. This change is necessary because your Kedro configuration archive will be stored in the `plugins/` folder, not the root directory:
```shell
    def execute(self, context):
        configure_project(self.package_name)
        with KedroSession.create(project_path=self.project_path,
                                 env=self.env, conf_source="plugins/conf-new_kedro_project.tar.gz") as session:
            session.run(self.pipeline_name, node_names=[self.node_name])
```

### Deployment on AWAA
1. Archive your three files: `new_kedro_project-0.1-py3-none-any.whl` and `conf-new_kedro_project.tar.gz` located in `new-kedro-project/dist`, and `logging.yml` located in `new-kedro-project/conf/` into a file called `plugins.zip` and upload it to `s3://your_S3_bucket`.
```shell
zip -j plugins.zip dist/new_kedro_project-0.1-py3-none-any.whl dist/conf-new_kedro_project.tar.gz conf/logging.yml
```
This archive will be later unpacked to the `/plugins` folder in the working directory of the Airflow container.

2. Create a new `requirements.txt` file, add the path where your Kedro project will be unpacked in the Airflow container, and upload `requirements.txt` to `s3://your_S3_bucket`:
```shell
./plugins/new_kedro_project-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```
Libraries from `requirements.txt` will be installed during container initialisation.

3. Upload `new_kedro_project_airflow_dag.py` from the `new-kedro-project/dags` to `s3://your_S3_bucket/dags`.
4. Create an empty `startup.sh` file for container startup commands. Set an environment variable for custom Kedro logging:
```shell
export KEDRO_LOGGING_CONFIG="plugins/logging.yml"
```
5. Set up a new [AWS MWAA environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/create-environment.html) using the following settings:
```shell
S3 Bucket:
  s3://your_S3_bucket
DAGs folder
  s3://your_S3_bucket/dags
Plugins file - optional
  s3://your_S3_bucket/plugins.zip
Requirements file - optional
  s3://your_S3_bucket/requrements.txt
Startup script file - optional
  s3://your_S3_bucket/startup.sh
```
On the next page, set the `Public network (Internet accessible)` option in the `Web server access` section if you want to access your Airflow UI from the internet. Continue with the default options on the subsequent pages.

6. Once the environment is created, use the `Open Airflow UI` button to access the standard Airflow interface, where you can manage your DAG.

## How to run a Kedro pipeline on Apache Airflow using a Kubernetes cluster

If you want to execute your DAG in an isolated environment on Airflow using a Kubernetes cluster, you can use a combination of the [`kedro-airflow`](https://pypi.org/project/kedro-airflow/) and [`kedro-docker`](https://pypi.org/project/kedro-docker/) plugins.

1. **Package your Kedro project as a Docker container**
   [Use the `kedro docker init` and `kedro docker build` commands](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins/tree/main/kedro-docker) to containerise your Kedro project.

2. **Push the Docker image to a container registry**
   Upload the built Docker image to a cloud container registry, such as AWS ECR, Google Container Registry, or Docker Hub.

3. **Generate an Airflow DAG**
   Run the following command to generate an Airflow DAG:
   ```sh
   kedro airflow create
   ```
   This will create a DAG file that includes the `KedroOperator()` by default.

4. **Modify the DAG to use `KubernetesPodOperator`**
   To execute each Kedro node in an isolated Kubernetes pod, replace `KedroOperator()` with `KubernetesPodOperator()`, as shown in the example below:

   ```python
   from airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.pod import KubernetesPodOperator

   KubernetesPodOperator(
       task_id=node_name,
       name=node_name,
       namespace=NAMESPACE,
       image=DOCKER_IMAGE,
       cmds=["kedro"],
       arguments=["run", f"--nodes={node_name}"],
       get_logs=True,
       is_delete_operator_pod=True,  # Cleanup after execution
       in_cluster=False, # Set to True if Airflow runs inside the Kubernetes cluster
       do_xcom_push=False,
       image_pull_policy="Always",
       # Uncomment the following lines if Airflow is running outside Kubernetes
       # cluster_context="k3d-your-cluster",  # Specify the Kubernetes context from your kubeconfig
       # config_file="~/.kube/config",  # Path to your kubeconfig file
   )
   ```

### Running multiple nodes in a single container

By default, this approach runs each node in an isolated Docker container. However, to reduce computational overhead, you can choose to run multiple nodes together within the same container. If you opt for this, you must modify the DAG accordingly to adjust task dependencies and execution order.

For example, in the [`spaceflights-pandas` tutorial](../tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.md), if you want to execute the first two nodes together, your DAG may look like this:

```python
from airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.pod import KubernetesPodOperator

with DAG(...) as dag:
    tasks = {
        "preprocess-companies-and-shuttles": KubernetesPodOperator(
            task_id="preprocess-companies-and-shuttles",
            name="preprocess-companies-and-shuttles",
            namespace=NAMESPACE,
            image=DOCKER_IMAGE,
            cmds=["kedro"],
            arguments=["run", "--nodes=preprocess-companies-node,preprocess-shuttles-node"],
            ...
        ),
        "create-model-input-table-node": KubernetesPodOperator(...),
        ...
    }

    tasks["preprocess-companies-and-shuttles"] >> tasks["create-model-input-table-node"]
    tasks["create-model-input-table-node"] >> tasks["split-data-node"]
    ...
```

In this example, we modified the original DAG generated by the `kedro airflow create` command by replacing `KedroOperator()` with `KubernetesPodOperator()`. Additionally, we merged the first two tasks into a single task named `preprocess-companies-and-shuttles`. This task executes the Docker image running two Kedro nodes: `preprocess-companies-node` and `preprocess-shuttles-node`.

Furthermore, we adjusted the task order at the end of the DAG. Instead of having separate dependencies for the first two tasks, we consolidated them into a single line:

```python
tasks["preprocess-companies-and-shuttles"] >> tasks["create-model-input-table-node"]
```

This ensures that the `create-model-input-table-node` task runs only after `preprocess-companies-and-shuttles` has completed.
