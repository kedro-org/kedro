# Prefect

This page explains how to run your Kedro pipeline using [Prefect 2.0](https://www.prefect.io/opensource), an open-source workflow management system.

The scope of this documentation is the deployment to a self hosted [Prefect Server](https://docs-2.prefect.io/latest/guides/host/), which is an open-source backend that makes it easy to monitor and execute your Prefect flows and automatically extends Prefect 2.0. We will use an [Agent that dequeues submitted flow runs from a Work Queue](https://docs-2.prefect.io/latest/concepts/deployments/#workers-and-work-pools).

```{note}
This deployment has been tested using Kedro 0.18.10 with Prefect version 2.10.17. If you want to deploy with Prefect 1.0, we recommend you review [earlier versions of Kedro's Prefect deployment documentation](https://docs.kedro.org/en/0.18.9/deployment/prefect.html).
```

## Prerequisites

To use Prefect 2.0 and Prefect Server, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Prefect 2.0 is installed](https://docs-2.prefect.io/latest/getting-started/installation/#installing-the-prefect-2-latest-version) on your machine

## Setup

Configure your `PREFECT_API_URL` to point to your local Prefect instance:

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"
```

For each new Kedro project you create, you need to decide whether to opt into [usage analytics](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins/tree/main/kedro-telemetry). Your decision is recorded in the `.telemetry` file stored in the project root.

```{important}
When you run a Kedro project locally, you are asked on the first `kedro` command for the project, but in this use case, the project will hang unless you follow these instructions.
```

Create a `.telemetry` file manually and put it in the **root of your Kedro project** and add your preference to give or decline consent. To do this, specify either `true` (to give consent) or `false`. The example given below accepts Kedro's usage analytics.

```text
consent: true
```

Run a Prefect Server instance:

```bash
prefect server start
```

In a separate terminal, [create a work pool](https://docs-2.prefect.io/latest/concepts/work-pools/#work-pool-configuration) to organise the work and [create a work queue](https://docs-2.prefect.io/latest/concepts/work-pools/#work-queues) for your agent to pull from:

```bash
prefect work-pool create --type prefect-agent <work_pool_name>
prefect work-queue create --pool <work_pool_name> <work_queue_name>
```

Now run a Prefect Agent that subscribes to a work queue inside the work pool you created:

```bash
prefect agent start --pool <work_pool_name> --work-queue <work_queue_name>
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline using Prefect 2.0

### Convert your Kedro pipeline to Prefect 2.0 flow

To build a [Prefect flow](https://docs-2.prefect.io/latest/concepts/flows/) for your Kedro pipeline programmatically and register it with the Prefect API, use the following Python script, which should be stored in your projectâ€™s **root directory**:

```python
# <project_root>/register_prefect_flow.py
import click
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List, Union, Callable

from kedro.framework.hooks.manager import _create_hook_manager
from kedro.framework.project import pipelines
from kedro.framework.session import KedroSession
from kedro.framework.startup import bootstrap_project
from kedro.io import DataCatalog, MemoryDataset
from kedro.pipeline.node import Node
from kedro.runner import run_node

from prefect import flow, task, get_run_logger
from prefect.deployments import Deployment

Then, run the deployment script in other terminal:

```bash
python register_prefect_flow.py --work_pool_name <work_pool_name> --work_queue_name <work_queue_name>
```

```{note}
Be sure that your Prefect Server is up and running. Verify that the deployment script arguments match the work pool and work queue names.
```

### Run Prefect flow

Now, having the flow registered, you can use [Prefect Server UI](https://docs-2.prefect.io/latest/guides/host/) to orchestrate and monitor it.

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/deployments to see your registered flow.

![prefect_2_flow_deployment](../meta/images/prefect_2_flow_deployment.png)

Click on the flow to open it and then trigger your flow using the "RUN" > "QUICK RUN" button and leave the parameters by default. If you want to run a specific pipeline you can replace the `__default__` value.

```{note}
Be sure that both your Prefect Server and Agent are up and running.
```
