# Debugging

``` {note}
Our debugging documentation has moved. Please see our existing guides:
```

* [Debugging a Kedro project within a notebook or IPython shell](../notebooks_and_ipython/kedro_and_notebooks.md#debugging-a-kedro-project-within-a-notebook) for information on how to debug using the `%load_node` line magic and an interactive debugger.
* [Debugging in VSCode](./set_up_vscode.md#debugging) for information on how to set up VSCode's built-in debugger.
* [Debugging in PyCharm](./set_up_pycharm.md#debugging) for information on using PyCharm's debugging tool.
* [Debugging in the CLI with Kedro Hooks](../hooks/common_use_cases.md#use-hooks-to-debug-your-pipeline) for information on how to automatically launch an interactive debugger in the CLI when an error occurs in your pipeline run.
