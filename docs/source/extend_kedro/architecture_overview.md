# Kedro architecture overview

There are different ways to leverage Kedro in your work, you can:

 - Commit to using all of Kedro (framework, project, starters and library); which is preferable to take advantage of the full value proposition of Kedro
 - You can use parts of Kedro, like the DataCatalog (I/O), OmegaConfigLoader, Pipelines and Runner, by using it as a Python library; this best supports a workflow where you don't want to adopt the Kedro project template
 - Or, you can develop extensions for Kedro e.g. custom starters, plugins, Hooks and more

At a high level, Kedro consists of five main parts:

## Kedro project

As a data pipeline developer, you will interact with a Kedro project, which consists of:

* The **`conf/`** directory, which contains configuration for the project, such as data catalog configuration, parameters, etc.
* The **`src`** directory, which contains the source code for the project, including:
  * The **`pipelines`**  directory, which contains the source code for your pipelines.
  * **`settings.py`** file contains the settings for the project, such as library component registration, custom hooks registration, etc. All the available settings are listed and explained in the [project settings chapter](../kedro_project_setup/settings.md).
  * **`pipeline_registry.py`** file defines the project pipelines, i.e. pipelines that can be run using `kedro run --pipeline`.
  * **`__main__.py`** file serves as the main entry point of the project in [package mode](../tutorial/package_a_project.md#package-a-kedro-project).
* **`pyproject.toml`** identifies the project root by providing project metadata, including:
  * `package_name`: A valid Python package name for your project package.
  * `project_name`: A human readable name for your project.
  * `kedro_init_version`: Kedro version with which the project was generated.

## Kedro framework

Kedro framework serves as the interface between a Kedro project and Kedro library components. The major building blocks of the Kedro framework include:

* **{py:mod}`~kedro.framework.session`** is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a Kedro run.
* **{py:mod}`~kedro.framework.context`** holds the configuration and Kedro's main functionality, and also serves as the main entry point for interactions with core library components.
* **{py:mod}`~kedro.framework.hooks`** defines all hook specifications available to extend Kedro.
* **{py:mod}`~kedro.framework.cli`** defines built-in Kedro CLI commands and utilities to load custom CLI commands from plugins.

## Kedro starter

You can use a [Kedro starter](../starters/starters.md) to generate a Kedro project that contains boilerplate code. We maintain a set of [official starters](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-starters/) but you can also use a custom starter of your choice.

## Kedro library

Kedro library consists of independent units, each responsible for one aspect of computation in a data pipeline:

* **{py:class}`~kedro.config.OmegaConfigLoader`** provides utility to parse and load configuration defined in a Kedro project.
* **{py:mod}`~kedro.pipeline`** provides a collection of abstractions to model data pipelines.
* **{py:mod}`~kedro.runner`** provides an abstraction for different execution strategy of a data pipeline.
* **{py:mod}`~kedro.io`** provides a collection of abstractions to handle I/O in a project, including `DataCatalog` and many `Dataset` implementations.

## Kedro extension

You can also extend Kedro behaviour in your project using a Kedro extension, which can be a custom starter, a Python library with extra hooks implementations, extra CLI commands such as [Kedro-Viz](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz) or a custom library component implementation.

If you create a Kedro extension, we welcome all kinds of contributions. Check out our [guide to contributing to Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/wiki/Contribute-to-Kedro). Dataset contributions to [`kedro-datasets`](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins/tree/main/kedro-datasets) are the most frequently accepted, since they do not require any changes to the framework itself. However, we do not discourage contributions to any of the other [`kedro-plugins`](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins).
