# FAQs

This is a growing set of technical FAQs. The [product FAQs on the Kedro website](https://kedro.org/#faq) explain how Kedro can answer the typical use cases and requirements of data scientists, data engineers, machine learning engineers and product owners.


## Installing Kedro
* [How do I install a development version of Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/wiki/Guidelines-for-contributing-developers)?

* **How can I check the version of Kedro installed?**
  To check the version installed, type `kedro -V` in your terminal window.
* **Do I need Git installed to use Kedro?**
  Yes, users are expected to have Git installed when working with Kedro. This is a prerequisite for the `kedro new` flow. If Git is not installed, use the following workaround: `kedro new -s https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-starters/archive/0.18.6.zip --directory=pandas-iris`

## What is data engineering convention?

[Bruce Philp](https://github.com/bruceaphilp) and [Guilherme Braccialli](https://github.com/gbraccialli-qb) are the
brains behind a layered data-engineering convention as a model of managing data. You can find an [in-depth walk through of their convention](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-importance-of-layered-thinking-in-data-engineering-a09f685edc71) as a blog post on Medium.

Refer to the following table below for a high level guide to each layer's purpose

> **Note**:The data layers donâ€™t have to exist locally in the `data` folder within your project, but we recommend that you structure your S3 buckets or other data stores in a similar way.

| Folder in data | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raw            | Initial start of the pipeline, containing the sourced data model(s) that should never be changed, it forms your single source of truth to work from. These data models are typically un-typed in most cases e.g. csv, but this will vary from case to case                                                                                                        |
| Intermediate   | Optional data model(s), which are introduced to type your `raw` data model(s), e.g. converting string based values into their current typed representation                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Primary        | Domain specific data model(s) containing cleansed, transformed and wrangled data from either `raw` or `intermediate`, which forms your layer that you input into your feature engineering                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Feature        | Analytics specific data model(s) containing a set of features defined against the `primary` data, which are grouped by feature area of analysis and stored against a common dimension                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Model input    | Analytics specific data model(s) containing all `feature` data against a common dimension and in the case of live projects against an analytics run date to ensure that you track the historical changes of the features over time                                                                                                                          |
| Models         | Stored, serialised pre-trained machine learning models                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Model output   | Analytics specific data model(s) containing the results generated by the model based on the `model input` data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Reporting      | Reporting data model(s) that are used to combine a set of `primary`, `feature`, `model input` and `model output` data used to drive the dashboard and the views constructed. It encapsulates and removes the need to define any blending or joining of data, improve performance and replacement of presentation layer without having to redefine the data models |
