# Introduction to Kedro

Kedro is an open-source Python framework to create reproducible, maintainable, and modular data science code. It uses software engineering best practices to help you build production-ready data science pipelines.

Kedro is hosted by the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/), and you can find the [Kedro source code on GitHub](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro).

In the following chapters, you will learn [how to set up Kedro](../get_started/install.md) and discover the [key Kedro concepts](../get_started/kedro_concepts.md). You can then review the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial_template.md) to get hands-on experience with a Kedro project.

For new and intermediate Kedro users, there's a comprehensive section on [working with Kedro and Jupyter notebooks](../notebooks_and_ipython/index.md).

Use the left-hand table of contents to explore the documentation available for more advanced Kedro usage and deployment. We also recommend the [glossary](../resources/glossary.md) and the {doc}`API reference documentation </api/kedro>`.

```{note}
We have designed the preliminary documentation and the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.md) for anyone new to Kedro. The more knowledge of Python you have, the easier you will find the learning curve.

There are many excellent online resources for learning Python; you should choose those that reference Python 3, as Kedro is built for Python 3.9+. There are curated lists of online resources, such as the [official Python programming language website](https://www.python.org/) and this list of [free programming books and tutorials](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books-langs.md#python).
