# Learn how to use Kedro

In the following chapters, you will learn [how to set up Kedro](../get_started/install.md) and discover the [key Kedro concepts](../get_started/kedro_concepts.md). You can then review the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial_template.md) to get hands-on experience with a Kedro project.

For new and intermediate Kedro users, there's a comprehensive section on [visualising Kedro projects using Kedro-Viz](../visualisation/kedro-viz_visualisation.md) and [working with Kedro and Jupyter notebooks](../notebooks_and_ipython/kedro_and_notebooks).

Use the left-hand table of contents to explore the documentation available for more advanced Kedro usage and deployment. We also recommend the [glossary](../resources/glossary.md) and the [API reference documentation](/kedro).

## Assumptions

We have designed the preliminary documentation and the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.md) for anyone new to Kedro. The more knowledge of Python you have, the easier you will find the learning curve.

```{note}
There are many excellent online resources for learning Python; you should choose those that reference Python 3, as Kedro is built for Python 3.8+. There are curated lists of online resources, such as the [official Python programming language website](https://www.python.org/) and this list of [free programming books and tutorials](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books-langs.md#python).
