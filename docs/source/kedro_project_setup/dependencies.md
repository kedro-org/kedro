# Dependencies

Both `pip install kedro` and `conda install -c conda-forge kedro` install the core Kedro module, which includes the CLI tool, project template, pipeline abstraction, framework, and support for configuration.

When you create a project, you then introduce additional dependencies for the tasks it performs.

## Declare project-specific dependencies

When you create a new Kedro project, Kedro generates a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of the project. The file contains the core dependencies and those related to the tools you choose to include in the project. Specifying the project's exact dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file makes it easier to run the project in the future, and avoids version conflicts downstream.


## Install project-specific dependencies

When someone clones your project, they can install the project-specific dependencies by navigating to the root directory of the project and running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install dependencies related to the Data Catalog

The [Data Catalog](../data/data_catalog.md) is your way of interacting with different data types in Kedro. You can use [`kedro-datasets`](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins/tree/main/kedro-datasets) to interact with the data used in your projects. Depending on the datasets that you use in your Data Catalog, you might need to include additional dependencies in your `requirements.txt`. The modular dependencies in this category include `pandas`, `numpy`, `pyspark`, `matplotlib`, `pillow`, `dask`, and more.

#### Install dependencies at a group-level

Data types are broken into groups e.g. `pandas`, `spark` and `pickle`. Each group has a collection of data types e.g.`pandas.CSVDataset`, `pandas.ParquetDataset` and more. You can install dependencies for an entire group of dependencies as follows:

```bash
pip install "kedro-datasets[<group>]"
```

This installs Kedro and dependencies related to the data type group. An example of this could be a workflow that depends on the data types in `pandas`. Run `pip install "kedro-datasets[pandas]"` to install Kedro and the dependencies for the data types in the [`pandas` group](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins/tree/main/kedro-datasets/kedro_datasets/pandas).

#### Install dependencies at a type-level

To limit installation to dependencies specific to a data type:

```bash
pip install "kedro-datasets[<group>-<dataset>]"
```

For example, your workflow might require the `pandas.ExcelDataset`, so to install its dependencies, run `pip install "kedro-datasets[pandas-exceldataset]"`.

```{note}
From `kedro-datasets` version 3.0.0 onwards, the names of the optional dataset-level dependencies have been normalised to follow [PEP 685](https://peps.python.org/pep-0685/). The '.' character has been replaced with a '-' character and the names are in lowercase. For example, if you had `kedro-datasets[pandas.ExcelDataset]` in your requirements file, it would have to be changed to `kedro-datasets[pandas-exceldataset]`.
```

## Reproducible environments
To ensure that the project dependencies and the transitive dependencies are pinned to specific versions, use [`pip-tools`](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) to compile `requirements.txt` file into a `requirements.lock` file.
To install `pip-tools` in your virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pip-tools
```

To add or remove dependencies to a project, edit the `requirements.txt` file, then run the following:

```bash
pip-compile <project_root>/requirements.txt --output-file <project_root>/requirements.lock
```

This will [pip compile](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools#example-usage-for-pip-compile) the requirements listed in the `requirements.txt` file into a `requirements.lock` that specifies a list of pinned project dependencies(those with a strict version). You can also use this command with additional CLI arguments such as `--generate-hashes`
to use `pip`'s Hash Checking Mode or `--upgrade-package` to update specific packages to the latest or specific versions.
[Check out the `pip-tools` documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) for more information.

```{note}
The `requirements.txt` file contains "source" requirements, while `requirements.lock` contains the compiled version of those and requires no manual updates. If you need to update the dependencies, update the `requirements.txt` file and re-run the `pip-compile` command.
```
