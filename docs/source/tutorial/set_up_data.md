# Set up the data

This section shows how to add datasets to the project's `data` folder. It also reviews how those datasets are registered in [Kedro's Data Catalog](../data/data_catalog.md), which is the registry of all data sources available for use by the project.

## Project datasets

The spaceflights tutorial makes use of three fictional datasets of companies shuttling customers to the Moon and back. The data comes in two different formats: `.csv` and `.xlsx`:

* `companies.csv` contains data about space travel companies, such as their location, fleet count and rating
* `reviews.csv` is a set of reviews from customers for categories, such as comfort and price
* `shuttles.xlsx` is a set of attributes for spacecraft across the fleet, such as their engine type and passenger capacity

The spaceflights starter has already added the datasets to the `data/01_raw` folder of your project.

## Dataset registration

The following information about a dataset must be registered before Kedro can load it:

* File location (path)
* Parameters for the given dataset
* Type of data
* Versioning

Open `conf/base/catalog.yml` for the spaceflights project to inspect the contents. The two `csv` datasets are registered as follows:

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

```yaml
companies:
  type: pandas.CSVDataset
  filepath: data/01_raw/companies.csv

reviews:
  type: pandas.CSVDataset
  filepath: data/01_raw/reviews.csv
```
</details> <br />

Likewise for the `xlsx` dataset:

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

```yaml
shuttles:
  type: pandas.ExcelDataset
  filepath: data/01_raw/shuttles.xlsx
  load_args:
    engine: openpyxl # Use modern Excel engine (the default since Kedro 0.18.0)
```
</details> <br />

The additional line, `load_args`, is passed to the excel file read method (`pd.read_excel`) as a [keyword argument](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html). Although not specified here, the equivalent output is `save_args` and the value would be passed to [`pd.DataFrame.to_excel` method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_excel.html).

### Test that Kedro can load the data

Open a `kedro ipython` session in your terminal from the project root directory:

```bash
kedro ipython
```

Then type the following into the IPython prompt to test load some `csv` data:

```python
companies = catalog.load("companies")
companies.head()
```

* The first command creates a variable (`companies`), which is of type `pandas.DataFrame` and loads the dataset (also named `companies` as per top-level key in `catalog.yml`) from the underlying filepath `data/01_raw/companies.csv`.
* The `head` method from `pandas` displays the first five rows of the DataFrame.

```
</details> <br />

Similarly, to test that the `xlsx` data is loaded as expected:

```python
shuttles = catalog.load("shuttles")
shuttles.head()
```

You should see output such as the following:

When you have finished, close `ipython` session with `exit()`.

### Custom data

{py:mod}`Kedro supports numerous datasets <kedro-datasets:kedro_datasets>` out of the box, but you can also add support for any proprietary data format or filesystem.

You can find further information about [how to add support for custom datasets](../data/how_to_create_a_custom_dataset.md) in specific documentation covering advanced usage.

### Supported data locations

Kedro uses [`fsspec`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to read data from a variety of data stores including local file systems, network file systems, HDFS, and all of the widely-used cloud object stores.
