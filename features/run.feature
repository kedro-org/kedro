    And the logs should show that "report_accuracy" was run

  Scenario: Run default python entry point without example code
    Given I have prepared a config file without starter

    And I have set the OmegaConfigLoader in settings
    When I execute the kedro command "package"
    Then I should get a successful exit code
    When I execute the kedro command "run --conf-source dist/conf-project_dummy.tar.gz"

    And I have prepared a run_config file with config options
    When I execute the kedro command "run --config run_config.yml --pipeline __default__"
    Then I should get a successful exit code
    And the logs should show that 4 nodes were run

  Scenario: Run kedro run with extra parameters
    Given I have prepared a config file
    And I have run a non-interactive kedro new with starter "default"
    When I execute the kedro command "run --params extra1=1,extra2=value2"
    Then I should get a successful exit code
    And the logs should show that 4 nodes were run

  Scenario: Run kedro run from within a sub-directory
    Given I have prepared a config file
    And I have run a non-interactive kedro new with starter "default"
    And I have changed the current working directory to "data"
    When I execute the kedro command "run"
    Then I should get a successful exit code
    And the logs should show that 4 nodes were run

  Scenario: Run kedro run without rich installed
